AB Phase Incremental Optical Rotary Encoder - 360P/R Wide Voltage Power Supply DC 5-24V 6mm Shaft Quadrature

Product Description
Functions
√ This incremental optical rotary encoder can be used to measure the rotational speed, angle and acceleration of the object and the length measurement.
√ This shaft encoder is suitable for a variety of intelligent control displacement measurement, automatic fixed- length automatic guillotine paper machine, steel cut length control, civilian measured height human scale, students racing robots.

Connection:
Yellow = A phase, Blue = B phase, Red = Vcc power +, Black = V0
Notice: AB 2phase output must not be directly connected with VCC, otherwise, it will burn the output triode.
